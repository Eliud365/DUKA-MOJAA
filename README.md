# Group Project Repository â€“ Print Queue Simulator

Welcome to the official repository for our group project. This is where **everyone in the group will commit their assigned code modules**.

---

## âœ… Guidelines for Contributing

Please read and follow these instructions **before you submit your work**:

### 1. **Commit Your Work Properly**
- Ensure your module/code is saved and complete.
- Push your code to the appropriate branch (or `main` if weâ€™re working directly on it).
- Write clear commit messages (e.g., `Added priority aging logic` or `Fixed job expiry bug`).

---

### 2. **Include All Necessary Files**
> ðŸ”´ Do **not** submit partial work or code that depends on files you havenâ€™t added.

Make sure:
- All required files (`.py`, `.js`, `.json`, etc.) are added.
- Your module **runs without errors**.
- Include any test files or sample input if needed.

---

### 3. **Test Before Submitting**
Make sure your code:
- **Runs without crashing**
- Produces expected output
- Is properly integrated with your module

> ðŸš¨ Do NOT push code that is broken or incomplete. This will slow down the integration process.

---

### 4. **Code Organization**
Place your work in the appropriate folder or clearly comment your section. If unsure, ask in the group chat or raise an issue here.

## ðŸ”§ Integration Plan
Once everyone has submitted, I (Eliud) will:
- Review and test all submissions
- Combine the working modules into a final, unified application
- Handle any necessary refactoring or cleanup
